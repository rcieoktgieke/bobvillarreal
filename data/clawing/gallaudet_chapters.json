          "Still, at times my actions come too close to being carelessly haphazard about it, as a drunk is careless, acting as though I have no regard for life, not understanding in an hour what any sane person knows in a minute.",
          "The sense of a presence near me is so strong that there must be an image to confirm the feeling. But there is only emptiness wherever I look. I set off again and feel the strange thing catch up in minutes with new immediacy, an insistent something demanding recognition. Now the sensation comes from off to the right, near the edge of the plateau. I study every feature with an intense stare. But once more, only the cold, barren land is my reward. Is this place bewitched? By what, exactly? Stillness and silence are the lone replies from the indefatigable source of man or spirit shadowing me.",
          "As for the missing miner, is his body still out there somewhere? Most likely. Perhaps he became lost and, at the end of his strength, sank to the earth and cloaked himself in dreams and snow. An entire, unknown world died with him. Who could know his failures, his fears, his loves, his deepest thoughts, his triumphs?"

I caught his movements out of the corner of my eye.<br />\"No one knows where we are.\"<br />\"What? What are you talking about?\"<br />\"No one knows where we are.\"<br />\"Patricio knows.\"<br />\"What if something happens to him?\" His raised voice alerted me to the tension he felt.<br />\"Don't worry. He'll come back.\"<br />\"What if he doesn't?\"<br />\"He has never failed me.\"<br />\"This may be the first time.\"<br />\"See the road over there? It's less than four miles away. We walk to it, wait for a vehicle, hitch a ride to the Customs Station, call him from there. Remember? We talked about escape.\"<br />He neither moved nor spoke for long moments and remained motionless the entire time. I watched him closely.<br />\"What's the matter?\"<br />\"I don't know. I just don't feel safe out here.\"<br />\"Why don't you feel safe?\"<br />\"There's no one within forty miles.\"<br />\"I made it clear all along we would be alone.\"<br />\"I guess I didn't understand what it meant.\"<br />\"And now you understand?\"<br />\"Yes.\"<br />\"And?\"<br />\"I want to leave. I don't want to stay here.\"<br />I moved over to where he sat and placed a hand on his shoulder.<br />\"Let's see what you feel in the morning.\"<br />\"I know what I'll feel.\"<br />\"What will you feel?\"<br />\"I won't want to stay here.\"<br />He raised his pan lid and flipped it the way one flips a Frisbee. The climb was over.",

The first visit here seared its memory upon my soul like the holy chrism of a sacrament, imprinted there for all eternity.

Such a time for me is now -- my strength is fading and my days are close to done. Yours are enduring for all eternity.\" In this seeming reversal of being and meaning, the mountain seems young, while I seem wizened; its expression seems fresh, while mine seems stale; its attitude seems light-hearted, while mine seems somber.",

At first, his appearance startles me, for this may be the moment of my final reckoning and atonement.<br />\"Do not worry, Bob, I am here so we might reminisce about our times together. We have been to the Andes' highest places and known their most enduring hardships. I wish to recall the adventures by taking you to where they happened.\"<br />He gestures me to accompany him.<br />\"But I am a mere mortal and cannot fly.\"<br />\"Touch my hand, Bob, and you will be raised up in more than this.\""
