Although it looks quite spartan, it's actually quite comfortable.","A stream fed by snowfields higher on the mountain flows by Atacama.","The road leading to Refugio Tejos (<span class=\"height\">18,860', 5750 m</span>).

This wasn't exactly his best side!","Looking into the mouth of the summit crater.","Self photo after James leaves.","We descend by way of the massive north face; the Tejos refugio is barely visible far below.","A magnificent sunset from our Base Camp.","We depart the Ojos region on the return to Copiapo.
