  "When James crosses the top of a rock the size of a small car, the monster shudders ever so slightly but remains in place. I know this because I stand directly underneath him, some twenty feet below, and for seconds I freeze to the spot not knowing what I should do, pee or flee."

  "I see the summit now and know we are almost there.<br/>\"Judy, what are you doing here?\"<br/>I halt in puzzlement. Judy? What? I turn to confront what must be a new addition to our climbing team. \"What'd you say?\"<br/>James points to a nearby boulder. \"That's my sister sitting on that rock. What's she doing here?\"\nMy altitude haze disappears in an instant. James is hallucinating!"
