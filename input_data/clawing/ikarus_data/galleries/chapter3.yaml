  caption: "The author has examined this photogravure closely and is convinced that it is the abandoned mine on the shores of Laguna Aguas Calientes that Giancarlo, Patricio, and he stayed at their first nights out to Llullaillaco. The Laguna is to the right. The mine buildings are somewhat indistinct. Still, their outlines suggest it is the Calientes mine. The overwhelming proof is that the peak to the right is surely Lastarria in its appearance and the mountain on the left is assuredly Llullaillaco. 1916 Original Photogravure of a Chilean Desert Borax Field.
