I must assure Your Majesty that my purpose in making these statements is to avoid eternal damnation by declaring myself guilty of participating in the destruction of a people so well governed as these natives and so free from transgressions and excesses, men as well as women."

      "The Incas were admired and respected by their subjects and by us, their conquerors. However, in order that we might bring them into the service of Our Lord, it was necessary to subjugate them, take away their Kingdom, and place it under the authority of the Royal Crown and Holy Mother Church. This we did by force of arms. Thus, the Lord our God made it possible for us to conquer this Kingdom, composed of a great multitude of subjects and riches, having permitted it by His great wisdom and because it was for His service that Christians entered this land."

      "Our captain, Diego de Almagro, was close to sixty-five years of age at the time of our journey. He had lost his left eye in a fight in Panama many years before and the black patch he wore gave him an intimidating appearance when one first encountered him. He was a man of contradictions, a man of strong passions, and at times not well-disposed to control them."

      "A word is necessary here about Captain Pedro de Alvarado. He was yet another seeking his fame and fortune in this unfortunate land of the Incas, and he distinguished himself often by his cruelty to the Indians. He was high-strung and vehement, and his speech was awe-inspiring but passionate to exaggeration. His temper was harsh and fiery, so that against his better judgment he was often carried away by anger, raising his voice to a high pitch as he spoke, uttering insults and then losing the thread of his discourse. At these times, he was most abusive, especially to the Indians. Curiously, however, he was a devout Catholic and could be seen at mass in the most humble of positions during its recitation and seeming to beg mercy for his conduct. One man who was able to control him very directly was Father Suarez. I suspect that Father, after witnessing firsthand particularly brutal conduct towards a native, probably threatened him with the loss of his eternal soul should such behavior continue. His authority from the Church and his imposing physical presence as well (as I shall relate later) probably both contributed to the respect shown by the Captain to this priest."

      "I must add here, Sire, that Captain Almagro distinguished himself in this fight, an encouragement and example for us all. For here was this man of advanced years not standing idly by directing his troops, but taking an active part in the battle itself, as if he had been in the flower of his manhood. It was a great incentive when we saw him compete in full armor with the foot-soldiers, and then again, as a horseman, drawing his sword with ease while his horse was at full gallop and then putting it back in its sheath effortlessly. In hurling the lance, he not only displayed great accuracy, but also vigor in the length of the cast, which many of us younger men could not surpass. In truth, he was an inspiration to us all."

      "We took up our travel along the shores of the lake by following the Inca road. One afternoon it began to rain, at times very heavily. The road here was straight; our horses and llamas needed little guidance, and they plodded along in an unhurried manner. Captain Almagro rode up and bade me ride with him for a short distance. Presently, he stopped and asked me to look out upon the road stretched out before us and to notice that at no point did the water from the rain collect upon the road's surface. Rather, it ran off to either side, there to collect in shallow channels. This phenomenon he had noticed for several miles and wished a response from me as to its cause, since the answer did not seem to lie in pure chance and therefore must lie in intelligent design."

      "We reached a site of great mystery just south of the southern-most part of the lake (Lake Titicaca). The Indians thereabout told us of immense stone monuments to the ancient gods and showed us the way to them, a place they call Tiwanaku. The captains knew that such a god must possess gold objects and silver ones also. What they found was less than was hoped for, for there was no gold, nor silver either. The stone structures and monoliths of strange looking beings seemed to have been fashioned by a race of giants. The stones were so great in size that we all marveled at how they could have come to be placed in this location."

      "At this point, I would like to relate to Your Majesty the partial contents of a letter I received many years ago from my friend, Cieza de Leon, about another matter concerning the Inca roads. I had asked him about the <em>chasqui</em> runners, those Indians who ran the roads from the city of Cuzco to the farthest corners of the empire and all points in between and returned to the sacred city with news for the great Inca. Don Cieza replied to me in this manner, that the empire of Peru is so vast that the Incas ordered roads built from Cuzco to the farthest reaches of it. If the king was at one of these extreme points, he learned what had taken place at the other. For one man to make such a journey, however, even by long marches, which the Indians are very capable of doing, still would take considerable time. The Incas, with a view to the efficient government of their empire, invented a system of posts, or way stations, which is the best way that they be thought of or imagined."

      "While here, a <em>chasqui</em> runner approached on the Inca road. He carried a <em>quipu</em> for the grain master, the Indian in charge of the grain supplies for the expedition, and asked that he be taken to him. Captain Alvarado, who was nearby, summoned this grain master to where we were and I observed him studying this <em>quipu</em> very intently for some time. These <em>quipu</em>s are the means by which the Indians convey matters of concern and interest from one important person to another throughout the kingdom, for they have no writing."

      "I will leave this matter for now, Sire, and tell something of the marvelous bridges the Incas built to span the rivers of their empire, for we came upon one of good size in this region. The river it spanned flowed through a gorge, one deep enough to prevent passage without help from man. Its construction was similar to others I saw on my travels through the empire."

Going up to him and looking in the distance where he pointed, we beheld coming towards us a most astonishing sight. It was a procession of Indians, moving slowly and deliberately. They were formed up into several columns, with an overseer in front carried in a litter. . . I consulted with Ancohualla and bade him come with me to tell Captain Almagro what was on the road."

There were seven men in the group, dressed plainly and simply, but with dignity. Captain Almagro ordered a general halt to the entire column for the noonday meal. In the meantime, using Ancohualla as interpreter and Paullu also, the Captain conducted business with these men. It was evident by their bearing and manner that they were of some consequence and authority in the town."

      "One day, late in the morning, my guides and I mounted a ridge and beheld a most wonderful sight. There, and now close, resided the mountains we must conquer if we wished to arrive in the land of Chile, their outlines clear and distinct in the cold, dry air. Captain Almagro and his officers joined us and we surveyed the magnificent scene to our front. Feliz pointed to Laudo, covered with snow on its southern flanks. Simpa motioned towards Incahuasi and the lower peaks between these two higher ones. Our route passed through those lower mountains, at the place to which Feliz gestured."

      "The weather held in our favor as our passage continued. Storm clouds appeared occasionally at the tops of peaks, but none descended to our level. Late one afternoon, however, our luck ended abruptly. We had secured camp and were preparing our dinner, when a gentle breeze began to stir the tents. It stayed mild at the beginning, yet soon a full gale struck with winds so furious they caused us to protect any loose object in the open. Fleeting wisps of clouds appeared above, there one minute and gone in an instant, the strength of the winds wiping them from the heavens. The gusts did not slacken in the least, even as the sun set and night came upon us. The shrieking noise sounded truly as the Furies might make if they be loosed from their bonds. Anything above ground, tents, lean-to's, cooking utensils, saddles, fell prey to this indefatigable ferocity."

      "Please grant me the favor, Sire, to say something about this man because he possessed many unique traits. He lost his father at an early age and was raised by his widowed mother. He showed, notwithstanding, that the loss of a father, although otherwise hard for a boy, need not prevent him from becoming a worthy and excellent man; and it is wrong among worthless men to lay upon a father's loss the blame for their perverted natures, due, they say, to early neglect. . . He caused a minor scandal on our journey by having the natives with us play their instruments at the masses he celebrated. In fact, the instant he did this, (when we passed Lake Titicaca), Captain Almagro, as Father mentioned to me afterwards, approached him and wished to know if such a mass conformed to the proper rites of Holy Mother Church. It did, he responded, and said he wanted to use it as a means to encourage the Indians to adopt our Holy Faith."
