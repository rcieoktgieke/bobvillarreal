  caption: "At the hour of Vespers on the 26th of July, Pizarro led the men to the city square lit by torch-light, where a couch had been placed at its center. Father Valverde accompanied the lord Inca and made the sign of the cross over him several times. Atahuallpa was told to sit, and one of our men placed a rope about his neck. While Fathers de Pedraza and de Segovia led us in the recitation of the Holy Creed, Atahuallpa was swiftly strangled. The priests said prayers over him in a final gesture to acknowledge his conversion to our Holy Faith. The Governor then ordered his body left in the square until the morrow. Artist: Everett Gee Jackson."
