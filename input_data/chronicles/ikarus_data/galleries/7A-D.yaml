  caption: "The ship Captains used an astrolabe like this 1550 model to navigate the southern oceans. An astrolabe is an elaborate inclinometer historically used by astronomers and navigators to measure the inclined position in the sky of a celestial body, day or night. The word means \\\"the one that catches the heavenly bodies.\\\" It can thus be used to identify stars or planets, to determine local latitudes, to survey, or to triangulate. It was used in classical antiquity, the Islamic Golden Age, the Middle Ages, and the Age of Discovery for all these purposes. R. Villarreal Collection."
