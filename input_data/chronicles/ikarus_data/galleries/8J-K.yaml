  caption: "According to Chilean legend, the <i>Caleuche</i> is a large ship sailing the seas around Chilo&eacute; (a small island off the coast of Chile) at night. The <i>Caleuche</i> is said to be a being who is conscious and sentient. The ship appears as a beautiful and bright white sailing ship, with 3 masts of 5 sails each, always full of lights and with the sounds of a party on board, but quickly disappears again, leaving no evidence of its presence. The ghost ship is also known to be able to navigate under water, just like another well known ghost ship, the <i>Flying Dutchman</i>. Courtesy of Nightwatch."
