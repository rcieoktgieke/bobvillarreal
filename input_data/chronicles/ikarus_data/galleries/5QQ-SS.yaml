  caption: "In Part SS, de M&eacute;rida describes fighting Mapuche deep within the thick forests to the south of Santiago:  \\\"When forced to travel through this darkness to seek out and subdue Mapuche forts and armed bands of hostiles, we felt ourselves to be within a colossal wilderness, so dark as to be almost black.
