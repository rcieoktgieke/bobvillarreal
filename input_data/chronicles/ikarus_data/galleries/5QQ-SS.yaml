Montesinos referred to this landscape as \\\"the dark\\\", a name we all quickly took up, for it described these murky places exactly.\\\"  Picture:  Forest scene in southern Chile.

  caption: "After leaving Isla Tolentino, the ships encountered hard winds.  Here is how Pastene described it in his journal:   \\\"September 12, 1544.  Our progress to the S was slowed early on the morning watch as unfavorable head winds blowing lustily at 39&deg;15&prime;S caused me to tack frequently 80 degrees to port and starboard as we beat before the wind.  At mid-day, we were in a full gale that blew with such violence that the San Pedro was almost driven forecastle under until I ordered the sails taken in, which eased the situation considerably.\\\"  Artist:  Lima de Freitas."
