  caption: "Since Cusco in the Inca language means \\\"navel,\\\" the lands of its kingdom were reached by four roads (pictured) beginning at the large square, the center of the Inca world. The region to the north to Quito was called Chinchaysuyu, with the royal road there named accordingly. The way to the southern area of Chile was called the Collasuysu. The Antisuyu road bore east to the lower valleys of the Amazon region. And the Contisuyu thoroughfare ran west to the lower valleys along the Pacific coast."
