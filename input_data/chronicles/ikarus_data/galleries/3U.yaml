  caption: "Antique print, titled: 'Chili.' - This map shows Chili. A very attractive map covering the known coastal region of Chile. The map is based on the cartography of Hessel Gerritsz with north oriented to the left although the compass rose incorrectly depicts north at top. The Andes are shown prominently, with two live volcanoes in the vicinity of Villarrica. San Juan is shown on a large spurious lake east of the Andes and incorrectly located south of Mendoza. The map is very decorative with a large scene of industrious natives and cherubs filling the entire top of the map. The ocean is embellished with two galleons and a compass rose. Description: From: 'De Nieuwe en Onbekende Weereld: of beschryving van America en 't Zuid-Land.', by Arnoldus Montanus, published in Amsterdam by Jacob van Meurs in 1671. (The New and Unknown World: or Description of America and the Southland, Containing the Origin of the Americans and South-landers, remarkable voyages thither, Quality of the Shores, Islands, Cities, Fortresses, Towns, Temples, Mountains, Sources, Rivers, Houses, the nature of Beasts, Trees, Plants and foreign Crops, Religion and Manners, Miraculous Occurrences, Old and New Wars: Adorned with Illustrations drawn from the life in America, and described by Arnoldus Montanus). The book was translated and published in England by the editor and map publisher John Ogilby under the title, America, Being an Accurate Description of the New World (1671). Ref: In the late 1630s, Holland attempted to reassert its claim over Brazil by establishing a series of forts along the coastline. One of the best-documented colonies was the expedition led by Prince Maurits of Nassau, who attempted to assemble an intellectual court in the New World. He brought with him a group of highly accomplished artists, mapmakers, and scientists to record the mysteries of Brazil. They included the celebrated painter Frans Post, and the astronomer George Markgraf, who produced the first serious study of the southern sky.   <span class=\\\"attribution\\\">R.
