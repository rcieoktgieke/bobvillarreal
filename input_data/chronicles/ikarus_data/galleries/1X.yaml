  caption: "Cerro Copayapu (Copiapo; <span class=\\\"height\\\">19,855'</span>) sits in the middle of the image. Laguna Santa Rosa is a few miles out of sight to the west (right of image). This view is above the approximate location where Captain Almagro, Paullu, and Lieutenant Castilla viewed the peak. Paullu requested that some of the Indians be allowed to climb to the top of the peak to place pieces of wood and stone on a high altar platform there, as an offering to the Sun. The Captain assented. The platform, by the way, actually exists."

Yet, in a supreme irony, it is plentiful in this and other parts of the country. Mina Marte closed years ago after exhausting its supply of the gold metal."
