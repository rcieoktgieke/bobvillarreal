The Expedition would have camped all along the south shore of the Laguna. The area experiences high winds most of the year."

  caption: " Captain Almagro granted de M&eacute;rida's request to inspect Ojos del Salado closer.  He says he saw a stream flowing down the side of the peak that emptied into a large sinkhole.  It may very well have been a stream like this one, which flows down the northern slopes.  <span class=\\\"attribution\\\">R. Villarreal Collection.</span>"

The view is south.  The wind storm struck the Expedition several miles to the east of this scene. The approximate location of the rock alcove is noted. This is where the soldiers placed three crosses to mark the deaths of their comrades. It is my contention that this event led to the peak being named \\\"Tres Cruces.\\\""
