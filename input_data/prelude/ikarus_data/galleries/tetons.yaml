  caption: "I went on a 10 day climbing excursion in the Grand Tetons in 1987, guided by the Exum Mountain Guides. We climbed the Grand Teton (13,770 feet), Middle Teton (12,805 feet), and Mount Moran (12,605 feet). It turned out that this proved good preparation for my guided climbs in the Andes with the American Alpine Institute in 1989-1991. Google Earth image."
