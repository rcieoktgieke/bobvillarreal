  caption: "Pichincha is an active volcano outside Quito, Ecuador. This Edward Whymper woodcut of 1892 shows three of Whymper's guides near the summit. Whymper was a famous naturalist, climber, and artist who climbed extensively in the Alps and the Andes. In 1880, he was the first climber to ascend a high altitude peak, in this case Chimborazo (20,400'). His signature appears in the lower left corner. See the delightful accounts of his climbs and travels in <em>Travels Amongst the Great Andes of the Equator</em>. <span class=\\\"attribution\\\">R. Villarreal Collection.</span>"

  caption: "El Cayambe (<span class=\\\"height\\\">18,996', 5790 m</span>) sits northeast of Quito. Its distinction is that the equator lies right on its southern slopes. We got this close to the peak before the guides determined that the entire lower portion of the Whymper route had been obliterated by avalanches. We pushed on to Cotopaxi."
