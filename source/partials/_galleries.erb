	<!-- The Ruby below does two important things. Firstly, it reads the filename matrix (gallery) declared in config.rb and defined in curtiss_image_process.rb, creates a <div> of class row for each row in the matrix, and then generates an <img> tag for each filename in the row. Secondly, it increments a counter (galleryIndex) for each operation, which it then passes to the <img> as part of its id. This becomes very important in the JavaScript. -->
